Workflows
=========

If you have not yet installed the ``pulp_container`` plugin on your Pulp installation, please follow our
:doc:`../installation`. These documents will assume you have the environment installed and
ready to go.

Recommended Tools
-----------------

**httpie**:
The REST API examples provided in this documentation use `httpie <https://httpie.org/doc>`_. A user
executing the commands via ``httpie`` is expected to have created the file ``.netrc`` in the home
directory. The file ``.netrc`` should have the following configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    machine localhost
    login admin
    password admin

By default, ``httpie`` uses the configuration retrieved from ``.netrc``. Due to this, a custom
Authorization header is always overwritten by the Basic Authorization with the provided login and
password. In order to send HTTP requests which contain JWT Authorization headers, ensure yourself
that the plugin `JWTAuth plugin <https://github.com/teracyhq/httpie-jwt-auth>`_ is installed.

If you configured the ``admin`` user with a different password, adjust the configuration
accordingly. If you prefer to specify the username and password with each request, please see
``httpie`` documentation on how to do that.

**jq**:
This documentation makes use of the `jq library <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_
to parse the json received from requests, in order to get the unique urls generated
when objects are created. To follow this documentation as-is please install the jq
library with:

``$ sudo dnf install jq``

**environment variables**:
To make these workflows copy/pastable, we make use of environment variables. The first variable to
set is the hostname and port::

   $ export BASE_ADDR=http://<hostname>:24817
